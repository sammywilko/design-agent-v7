# Beat Structure & Narrative Development - Universal Principles

## What Is A Beat?
A beat is the smallest unit of story. It's a single exchange, action, or shift that moves the narrative forward. Every beat should change something - status, knowledge, emotion, or situation.

**Universal Rule**: If nothing changes, it's not a beat - it's filler.

## BEAT ANATOMY

### Universal Components
1. **Setup**: Establish the current state
2. **Action**: Something happens/is said
3. **Reaction**: Response to the action
4. **Shift**: Something is now different

### The Change Requirement
Every beat must earn its place by changing:
- **Status** (power dynamics shift)
- **Knowledge** (information revealed)
- **Emotion** (feeling changes)
- **Situation** (circumstances alter)

### Good vs Bad Beats

**Good beat**: "Character enters confidently, sees rival, confidence wavers"
- Change: Emotional state shifted

**Bad beat**: "Character walks down hallway"
- Change: Location only (not meaningful unless context makes it significant)

### The Escalation Principle
Within a sequence, each beat slightly escalates:
- Stakes get higher
- Shots get tighter

After intensity, audience needs recovery:
- Post-climax quiet moment
- Comedy beat after tension
- Wide shot after tight sequence
