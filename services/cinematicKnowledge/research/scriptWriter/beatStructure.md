# Beat Structure & Narrative Development

## What Is A Beat?
A beat is the smallest unit of story. It's a single exchange, action, or shift that moves the narrative forward. Every beat should change something - status, knowledge, emotion, or situation.

## Beat Anatomy

### Components
1. **Setup**: Establish the current state
2. **Action**: Something happens/is said
3. **Reaction**: Response to the action
4. **Shift**: Something is now different

### The Change Requirement
If nothing changes, it's not a beat - it's filler. Every beat must earn its place.

**Good beat**: "Character enters confidently, sees rival, confidence wavers"
- Change: Emotional state shifted

**Bad beat**: "Character walks down hallway"
- Change: Location only (not meaningful unless context makes it significant)

## Beat Types

### SETUP BEAT
- **Purpose**: Establish information audience needs later
- **Feel**: Can feel expository if not disguised
- **Technique**: Hide setup in character business/conflict
- **Duration**: Keep tight - don't linger

### DEVELOPMENT BEAT
- **Purpose**: Progress plot or character forward
- **Feel**: Momentum, building
- **Technique**: Each beat escalates stakes slightly
- **Duration**: Varies - faster as tension builds

### TURNING POINT BEAT
- **Purpose**: Major direction change
- **Feel**: Surprise, pivot, revelation
- **Technique**: Set up expectation, subvert it
- **Duration**: Quick beat, long aftermath

### CLIMAX BEAT
- **Purpose**: Peak tension/emotion release
- **Feel**: Maximum intensity
- **Technique**: Everything built to this moment
- **Duration**: Can extend - earned emotional release

### RESOLUTION BEAT
- **Purpose**: Return to stability (new normal)
- **Feel**: Release, completion, reflection
- **Technique**: Mirror opening in new context
- **Duration**: Brief - don't overstay

## Scene Structure (Sequence of Beats)

### Classic 3-5 Beat Scene
1. **Entry beat**: Establish location, character state
2. **Conflict beat**: Introduce scene's central tension
3. **Escalation beat**: Tension increases
4. **Peak beat**: Maximum scene tension
5. **Exit beat**: Resolution or hook to next scene

### Short-Form Structure (15-60 seconds)
1. **Hook** (0-3 sec): Grab attention
2. **Setup** (3-10 sec): Establish situation
3. **Development** (10-25 sec): Build to payoff
4. **Payoff** (25-45 sec): Deliver the point
5. **Button** (45-60 sec): Memorable close

## Beat Pacing

### Fast Beats (2-5 seconds)
- Action sequences
- Quick cuts
- Montages
- Building urgency

### Medium Beats (5-15 seconds)
- Dialogue exchanges
- Standard scenes
- Most of your story

### Slow Beats (15-30+ seconds)
- Emotional moments
- Revelations processing
- Contemplative sequences
- Earned moments only

## Visual Beat Scoring

### High Energy Beat
- Faster cuts (1-3 seconds per shot)
- Dynamic camera movement
- Tighter shots
- Contrast in lighting

### Low Energy Beat
- Longer takes (5+ seconds)
- Static or slow camera
- Wider shots
- Even, soft lighting

### Transition Beat
- Match cuts
- Visual motifs
- Sound bridges
- Dissolves/fades

## Beat Flow Rules

### The Alternating Principle
Don't stack same-energy beats. Vary:
- High → Low → Medium → High
- Tension → Relief → Tension
- Fast → Slow → Fast

### The Escalation Principle
Within a sequence, each beat slightly escalates:
- Stakes get higher
- Shots get tighter
- Pace gets faster
- Emotions intensify

### The Breathing Room Principle
After intensity, audience needs recovery:
- Post-climax quiet moment
- Comedy beat after tension
- Wide shot after tight sequence

## Beat Integration with Camera

### Beat + Shot Size
| Beat Energy | Shot Size | Movement |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Setup | Wide/Medium | Slow or static |
| Development | Medium | Push in |
| Escalation | Medium to Close | Tracking/tightening |
| Climax | Close/ECU | Dynamic or static hold |
| Resolution | Pull to Medium/Wide | Slow pull back |

### Beat + Duration
- Entry beats: Establish quickly (3-5 sec)
- Conflict beats: Time to build (8-15 sec)
- Peak beats: Earned length (10-20 sec)
- Exit beats: Don't linger (3-8 sec)

## Common Beat Mistakes

### Flat Scene (No Arc)
- Same energy throughout
- Fix: Identify peak, build to it, resolve from it

### Missing Setup
- Payoff without foundation
- Fix: Plant information before you need it

### Overstaying
- Beat goes on after purpose served
- Fix: Cut when the change happens

### Unclear Change
- Beat ends same as it started
- Fix: Identify what shifts, emphasize it

## Beat Sheet Template

For each beat, define:
1. **Goal**: What this beat accomplishes
2. **Change**: What shifts (emotion/plot/character)
3. **Visual**: Shot type/movement/lighting
4. **Duration**: Estimated seconds
5. **Transition**: How it connects to next beat
