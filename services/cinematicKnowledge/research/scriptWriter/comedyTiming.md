# Comedy Timing Neuroscience

## The Science
Comedy timing is precise brain manipulation. The laugh response requires specific neural pathways to fire in sequence - timing disrupts or enables this.

## The 2-3 Second Rule

### Why It Exists
- Brain needs 1-2 seconds to process unexpected information
- Recognition triggers dopamine release
- Too fast = confusion (no processing time)
- Too slow = anticipation deflates (lost surprise)

### Application
- **Setup**: Normal pace, establish expectation
- **Pause**: 0.5-1 second before punchline (builds anticipation)
- **Punchline**: Quick delivery
- **Hold**: 2-3 seconds reaction time before next beat

### The Reaction Hold
**Critical**: After a joke lands, hold on the reactor for 2-3 seconds
- Audience needs to see someone else "get it"
- Mirror neurons fire - we laugh WITH the reactor
- Cutting away too fast kills the laugh

## The Rule of Three

### Pattern
Setup (1) → Confirmation (2) → Subversion (3)

### Neuroscience
- Brain loves patterns (predictability = safety)
- Two items establish pattern
- Third item: brain expects continuation, gets surprise
- Pattern break + recognition = dopamine hit = laugh

### Examples
- "I came, I saw, I forgot what I was doing"
- "Fast, cheap, good - pick two"
- A, A, B structure (serious, serious, absurd)

### Beat Breakdown
1. **First item**: Establish tone/direction
2. **Second item**: Confirm pattern, build expectation
3. **Third item**: Subvert with unexpected twist

## Timing Beats for Comedy

### The Double Take
1. Character sees thing (0.5s)
2. Character looks away (0.5s)
3. Character snaps back (0.25s)
4. HOLD reaction (2-3s)

### The Slow Burn
1. Triggering event
2. Character processes (escalating expression)
3. Hold building reaction (3-5s)
4. Peak expression
5. Cut to next beat

### The Quick Cut Comedy
- Setup in shot A
- Punchline in immediate cut to shot B
- NO pause between
- Surprise through editing

## Shot Timing for Comedy

### Wide Shot Comedy
- Physical comedy needs space
- Hold wider = see the whole gag
- Longer takes = building absurdity
- Example: Someone walking into glass door - need to see approach, impact, aftermath

### Close-Up Comedy
- Reaction shots
- Subtle expressions
- "Did you see what I saw?" beats
- Shorter holds - expression IS the joke

### Timing Adjustment by Shot Size
| Shot Size | Hold Length | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| EWS | 4-6 seconds | Need time to find the gag |
| WS | 3-5 seconds | Physical comedy needs space |
| MS | 2-4 seconds | Standard comedic rhythm |
| CU | 1-3 seconds | Expression reads fast |
| ECU | 0.5-2 seconds | Micro-expression beats |

## Comedy Editing Rhythm

### Standard Pattern
1-1-2 or 1-1-1-3 (beats of emphasis)

### The Pregnant Pause
- Cut TO the pause, not through it
- Static shot of waiting face
- Let discomfort build
- Audience anticipates release

### Callback Timing
- First mention: plant casually (don't emphasize)
- Second mention: audience starts to recognize
- Third mention: payoff (hold for recognition laugh)
- Gap between callbacks: 2-5 minutes for short form

## Common Comedy Timing Mistakes

### Too Fast
- Joke lands but no laugh - moved on too quickly
- Fix: Add 1-2 second holds after punchlines

### Too Slow
- Setup drags, anticipation becomes boredom
- Fix: Tighten setup, deliver punchline earlier

### Missing the Reaction
- Great line but cut away immediately
- Fix: Always include reactor shot, hold 2-3 seconds

### Telegraphing
- Setup makes punchline obvious
- Fix: Misdirect, subvert expected pattern

## Visual Comedy Timing

### The Slow Zoom
- Something wrong in frame
- Slow push to absurd detail
- Hold on discovery
- Used for "wait, what?" moments

### Whip Pan to Reveal
- Fast pan to unexpected thing
- Hold static on reveal
- Comedy through contrast of movement/stillness

### Freeze Frame
- Action freezes at peak absurdity
- Record scratch optional
- Good for "you're probably wondering" beats
