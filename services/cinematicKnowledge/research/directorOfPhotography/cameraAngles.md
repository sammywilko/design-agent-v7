# Camera Angle Psychology

## The Science
Camera angles bypass conscious thought and trigger immediate emotional responses through evolutionary hardwiring.

## Angle Reference Guide

### LOW ANGLE (Looking Up)
- **Psychology**: Power, dominance, heroism, threat
- **Neuroscience**: Mimics the perspective of a child looking at an adult - triggers subconscious feelings of being small/vulnerable relative to subject
- **Use When**: Hero moments, villain reveals, empowerment beats, product dominance
- **Avoid When**: You want audience to relate to character as equal
- **Technical Notes**:
  - Extreme low (worm's eye) = godlike/monumental
  - Slight low (15°) = confident/capable
  - Works best with wide lenses to exaggerate height

### HIGH ANGLE (Looking Down)
- **Psychology**: Vulnerability, weakness, being observed, insignificance
- **Neuroscience**: Puts viewer in position of power/judgment - activates observational distance
- **Use When**: Character defeat, loneliness, overwhelming odds, surveillance feeling
- **Avoid When**: Character should feel strong or relatable
- **Technical Notes**:
  - Extreme high (bird's eye) = ant-like/pattern recognition
  - Slight high (15°) = gentle observation
  - Flattens subjects, good for showing spatial relationships

### EYE LEVEL
- **Psychology**: Equality, relatability, neutrality, conversation
- **Neuroscience**: Natural human interaction height - creates peer relationship
- **Use When**: Dialogue, documentary feel, establishing character as "one of us"
- **Default Choice When**: In doubt, use eye level - it's invisible to audience
- **Technical Notes**:
  - Most "honest" angle - no manipulation
  - Best for talking heads and interviews
  - Camera at 5'6" - 5'8" for standing adults

### DUTCH ANGLE (Tilted)
- **Psychology**: Unease, disorientation, something wrong, psychological instability
- **Neuroscience**: Brain expects horizon to be level - tilt creates cognitive dissonance
- **Use When**: Mental instability, danger, surreal moments, transitions
- **Avoid When**: You want comfortable viewing (overuse = amateur hour)
- **Technical Notes**:
  - 15-30° is subtle unease
  - 45° is maximum before it reads as intentional stylization
  - Best used sparingly - 1-2 per scene max

### OVERHEAD (Bird's Eye)
- **Psychology**: Omniscience, fate, patterns, disconnection
- **Neuroscience**: Impossible natural perspective triggers awareness of "someone watching"
- **Use When**: Establishing geography, choreography, god's-eye revelation, death scenes
- **Technical Notes**:
  - Pure overhead (90°) = most detached
  - Slight angle (70-80°) = more narrative engagement
  - Good for showing relationship between elements

## Angle Transitions (The Art)

### Power Shift Sequence
LOW → EYE → HIGH = Character fall from grace

### Revelation Sequence
HIGH → EYE → LOW = Character empowerment arc

### Tension Building
EYE → slight DUTCH → full DUTCH = Growing unease

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Desired Emotion | Primary Angle | Backup Option |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| Power/Heroism | Low angle | Slight low with wide lens |
| Vulnerability | High angle | Eye level with isolation |
| Equality/Trust | Eye level | Slight low for confidence |
| Unease/Tension | Dutch | High angle with shadows |
| Omniscience | Overhead | High wide shot |
| Intimacy | Eye level CU | Slight low MCU |
