# Shot Types - Emotional Impact Guide

## The Science
Shot size controls psychological distance. Closer = more emotional engagement. Wider = more context/isolation.

## Shot Size Reference

### EXTREME WIDE SHOT (EWS)
- **What It Shows**: Full environment, subject tiny or absent
- **Emotional Impact**: Scale, loneliness, journey, epic scope
- **Brain Response**: Triggers exploration instinct, context-seeking
- **Use When**:
  - Opening a scene/film (establishing)
  - Showing journey/distance traveled
  - Emphasizing character vs environment
  - Epic/grandiose moments
- **Technical Notes**:
  - Subject should be <10% of frame
  - Environment IS the subject
  - Often static or very slow movement

### WIDE SHOT (WS)
- **What It Shows**: Full body + environment context
- **Emotional Impact**: Context, physical action, spatial relationships
- **Brain Response**: Allows full body language reading + environment assessment
- **Use When**:
  - Action sequences
  - Dance/movement
  - Showing character in their world
  - Group dynamics
- **Technical Notes**:
  - Subject fills ~30-50% of frame height
  - Headroom and footroom both visible
  - Good for showing costume/wardrobe

### MEDIUM WIDE SHOT (MWS / "Cowboy Shot")
- **What It Shows**: Head to mid-thigh
- **Emotional Impact**: Casual observation, Western standoff energy
- **Brain Response**: Comfortable social distance - like seeing someone across a room
- **Use When**:
  - Walking and talking
  - Showdowns
  - Fashion/outfit emphasis
  - Comfortable observation
- **Technical Notes**:
  - Named for Westerns (shows holstered gun)
  - Good transition between wide and medium

### MEDIUM SHOT (MS)
- **What It Shows**: Head to waist (or just below)
- **Emotional Impact**: Conversational, engaged but not intimate
- **Brain Response**: Normal social interaction distance - feels like conversation
- **Use When**:
  - Dialogue (default choice)
  - Interviews
  - Product demonstrations
  - Balanced emotion + context
- **Technical Notes**:
  - Most versatile shot size
  - Shows gesture + expression
  - Safe choice when unsure

### MEDIUM CLOSE-UP (MCU)
- **What It Shows**: Head and shoulders
- **Emotional Impact**: Attention, importance, beginning of intimacy
- **Brain Response**: Signals "pay attention to this person" - heightened focus
- **Use When**:
  - Important dialogue lines
  - Reaction shots
  - Introducing characters
  - "Newsreader" presentations
- **Technical Notes**:
  - Cuts below shoulders, above chest
  - Most common shot in TV
  - Good for showing subtle expression

### CLOSE-UP (CU)
- **What It Shows**: Face fills frame
- **Emotional Impact**: Intimacy, intensity, emotional peak, truth
- **Brain Response**: Mirror neurons activate - we FEEL what they feel
- **Use When**:
  - Emotional peaks
  - Lies/truth reveals
  - Critical decisions
  - Intimate moments
- **Technical Notes**:
  - Eyes in upper third
  - Minimal or no headroom
  - Use sparingly for maximum impact

### EXTREME CLOSE-UP (ECU)
- **What It Shows**: Single feature (eyes, lips, hands, object)
- **Emotional Impact**: Hyper-focus, abstraction, fetishization, detail
- **Brain Response**: Demands attention - unusual perspective triggers alertness
- **Use When**:
  - Critical detail reveals
  - Product beauty shots
  - Psychological intensity
  - Sensory moments (taste, touch)
- **Technical Notes**:
  - Often macro lens territory
  - Can feel invasive - use intentionally
  - Great for transitions

## Shot Selection by Emotion

| Emotion Needed | Primary Shot | Enhancement |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Loneliness | EWS with tiny subject | Desaturated colors |
| Power | Low angle WS | Dynamic lens |
| Intimacy | CU | Shallow DoF |
| Tension | MCU cutting to CU | Tightening sequence |
| Joy | MS to MCU | Bright lighting |
| Fear | CU to ECU | Dutch tilt |
| Scale/Epic | EWS | Slow crane up |
| Connection | Over-shoulder to CU | Eye level |

## The Tightening Rule
**Emotional intensity = tighter shot**

Sequence example for building tension:
1. WS - Establish situation
2. MS - Focus attention
3. MCU - Build engagement
4. CU - Emotional peak
5. ECU - Critical detail/reaction

Never jump more than 2 sizes without motivated cut (action, time skip).

## Shot Size + Movement Combinations

- **EWS + Slow push** = Drawing viewer into world
- **WS + Track** = Journey/following action
- **MS + Static** = Comfortable observation
- **CU + Slow push** = Increasing intensity
- **ECU + Static** = Uncomfortable attention
