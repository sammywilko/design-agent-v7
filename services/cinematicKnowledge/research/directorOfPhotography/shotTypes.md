# Shot Types - Universal Emotional Impact Guide

## The Neuroscience
Shot size controls psychological distance. Closer = more emotional engagement. Wider = more context/isolation. These principles apply universally across all visual content types.

**Core Rule**: Emotional intensity increases as shots get TIGHTER.
