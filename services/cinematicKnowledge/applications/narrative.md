## Content Definition

## KEY VISUAL PRINCIPLES

### Primary Goals
1. **Story clarity** - visual supports narrative
2. **Emotional engagement** - audience feels with characters
3. **Character development** - visual arc mirrors emotional arc
4. **Motivated cinematography** - every choice serves story

---

## THE FUNDAMENTAL RULE

### Tightening = Intensity
As emotional intensity increases, shots get TIGHTER.
- Wide shots = context, distance, observation
- Medium shots = engagement, conversation
- Close shots = intimacy, emotion, truth
- Extreme close = critical detail, peak emotion

---

## SHOT TYPE APPLICATIONS

### ECU (Extreme Close-Up)
- **Critical detail** - plot-important object
- **Psychological intensity** - character mental state
- **Sensory moment** - taste, touch, pain, texture
- **Object significance** - symbolic meaning
- **Maximum emotional peak** - eyes during revelation

### CU (Close-Up)
- **Emotional peaks** - most intense moments
- **Truth/lies** - reading character honesty
- **Critical decisions** - internal conflict visible
- **Intimate moments** - love, grief, joy, fear
- **Reaction shots** - seeing impact

### MCU (Medium Close-Up)
- **Important dialogue** - key lines emphasized
- **Reaction emphasis** - character response
- **Character introduction** - first impression
- **Emotional transition** - feeling shift
- **Interview/testimonial** - authentic connection

### MS (Medium Shot)
- **Dialogue default** - conversation standard
- **Balanced emotion + context** - most scenes
- **Character interaction** - two-shots
- **Physical business** - gesture visible
- **Action with character** - doing + feeling

### MWS (Medium Wide Shot)
- **Standoff/confrontation** - tension without intimacy
- **Walking and talking** - dialogue in motion
- **Character introduction** - full impression
- **Physical relationship** - two characters' positions

### WS (Wide Shot)
- **Action sequences** - movement and choreography
- **Blocking** - character positions clear
- **Environment interaction** - character in space
- **Group dynamics** - multiple characters
- **Establishing behavior** - how character exists in world

### EWS (Extreme Wide Shot)
- **Opening establishing** - where are we?
- **Character vs world** - showing stakes, scale
- **Journey/distance** - time and space traveled
- **Emotional isolation** - character alone
- **Epic moments** - scope and grandeur

---

## CAMERA ANGLE APPLICATIONS

### Low Angle
- **Character dominance** - who has power
- **Hero triumph** - victory moment
- **Villain threat** - menacing, dangerous
- **Revelation of power** - character stepping into control
- **Aspiration** - character we admire

### Eye Level
- **Dialogue scenes** - standard for conversation
- **Character as equal** - audience on same level
- **Documentary feel** - authentic observation
- **Neutral information** - letting audience judge
- **Default choice** - when story doesn't require otherwise

### High Angle
- **Character defeat** - lowest emotional moments
- **Being watched** - surveillance, paranoia
- **Isolation** - character alone, overwhelmed
- **Divine judgment** - moral weight
- **Vulnerability** - audience judges character

### Dutch Angle
- **Mental instability** - character psychology deteriorating
- **Danger/threat** - something wrong in the world
- **Transition moments** - reality shifting
- **Villain POV** - disturbed perspective
- **USE SPARINGLY** - maximum 1-2 per scene

### Overhead
- **Establishing geography** - scene layout
- **Fate/destiny** - character's path visible
- **Death scenes** - disconnection, departure
- **Pattern revelation** - audience sees what characters can't

## LIGHTING FOR NARRATIVE

### Story-Driven Lighting
Lighting should serve the story, not style for its own sake.

### Light as Emotion
| Emotion | Lighting Approach |
|---------|------------------|
| Joy | High key, warm |
| Sadness | Soft, cool, muted |
| Fear | Low key, shadows |
| Anger | Hard, contrast |
| Love | Soft, warm, golden |
| Mystery | Low key, motivated |
| Truth | Even, clear |
| Deception | Shadows, partial |

### Character Lighting
- **Hero**: Well-lit, clear, visible
- **Villain**: Shadow, partial, mysterious
- **Victim**: Soft, vulnerable
- **Authority**: Strong, defined

### Motivated Lighting
Every light should have a "reason" in the scene:
- Window light
- Practical lamps
- Fire/candles
- Screens/devices
- Overhead fixtures

## BEAT STRUCTURE FOR NARRATIVE

### Classic Three-Act Structure

#### Act 1 (Setup - 25%)
- World establishing
- Character introduction
- Stakes establishment
- Inciting incident
- **Visuals**: Wider shots, establishing, eye level

#### Act 2 (Confrontation - 50%)
- Rising action
- Complications
- Character development
- Midpoint shift
- **Visuals**: Progressive tightening, varied angles

#### Act 3 (Resolution - 25%)
- Climax
- Resolution
- New normal
- **Visuals**: Tightest at climax, widen for resolution

### Scene Structure (5-Beat Model)
1. **Entry**: Establish location, character state
2. **Conflict**: Introduce scene tension
3. **Escalation**: Tension increases
4. **Peak**: Maximum scene tension
5. **Exit**: Resolution or hook to next scene

### Visual Beat Progression
| Beat | Shot Size | Movement | Energy |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Entry | Wide/Medium | Slow/static | Low |
| Conflict | Medium | Building | Rising |
| Escalation | Tightening | Dynamic | High |
| Peak | Close/ECU | Hold or burst | Maximum |
| Exit | Variable | Resolving | Decreasing |

## COMEDY IN NARRATIVE

### Full Comedy Toolkit
- **2-3 second reaction rule** - let laughs land
- **Rule of three** - setup, setup, subvert
- **Double take** - classic timing sequence
- **Slow burn** - building frustration
- **Pregnant pause** - uncomfortable silence

### Visual Comedy
- **Physical comedy needs wide shots** - see the whole gag
- **Reaction comedy needs close-ups** - see the face
- **Timing through editing** - cut rhythm creates comedy

---

## CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS

### Character Consistency
- **Appearance** - same throughout unless story requires change
- **Costume** - continuity across scenes
- **Performance** - energy level appropriate to story point
- **Physical continuity** - wounds, damage, etc.

### Environment Consistency
- **Location** - same space across angles
- **Time** - lighting matches time of day
- **Weather** - consistency across scene
- **Props** - position continuity

### Emotional Consistency
- **Arc tracking** - character emotion follows logical progression
- **Beat-to-beat** - emotion flows naturally
- **Scene-to-scene** - appropriate transitions

---

## PRODUCTION CONSIDERATIONS

### Priority Coverage
1. **Master shot** - full scene safety coverage
2. **Key dialogue** - both sides of conversation
3. **Reactions** - essential for editing
4. **Inserts** - plot-important details
5. **Establishing** - context shots

### Scene Coverage Pattern
1. Wide master (full scene)
2. Two-shot (if applicable)
3. Singles (each character)
4. Close-ups (key moments)
5. Inserts (details)

### Common Challenges
- Maintaining continuity across takes
- Coverage for editing flexibility
- Actor performance consistency
- Time/budget constraints on coverage
